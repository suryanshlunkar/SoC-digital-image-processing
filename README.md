# SoC-digital-image-processing
Summer of code dive into digital image processing

Initially we learnt the basics of numpy and python using some online tutotials

then we started off by leaning about what images basically are, i.e they basically matrices with data about color of each pixel
there itself the concept of bits per pixel arises, more the bits per pixel, the more varueties of color you can get

then we learnt menthods of conversion of images from RGB to grayscale

then we learnt about histograms and how they are useful in image processing
and how processes like histogram stretching can be used to convert/ increase the contrast of an image

then we learnt about concepts like Concept of Convolution
Concept of Mask
Concept of Blurring
Sobel Operator
etc, which i think i'll have to go through again to understand more in depth

then , we were given an assignment regarding histgram stretching, there, we were supposed ti increase the contrast of the image, which actually magically turned a complete black image to a black and white one, and it was depicting cell division

After this , there was a dead week, during which we were supposed to learn about PCA(principal component analysis), there were quite a lot of videos about it,  in simple words , it is  used to reduce dimensionality of the given data-set, which turns out to be helpful when we are training machine learning models, or while representation of the data

The pricipal components are basically the eigen vectors of the covariance matrix , the covariance matrix is obtained by calculating covariance between each pair of variables

Mathematically, the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix represent the directions along which the data varies the most. The first eigenvector corresponds to the direction of maximum variance in the data, and each subsequent eigenvector represents orthogonal directions of decreasing variance.

After this we were given an Assignment 2, of which the first qurestion was easily doable , but the second one required some help

After this, we are learning edge detection, which is a very important part of the digital image processing,  and we have to use that to solve the assignment 3
