# SoC-digital-image-processing
Summer of code dive into digital image processing

Initially we learnt the basics of numpy and python using some online tutotials

then we started off by leaning about what images basically are, i.e they basically matrices with data about color of each pixel
there itself the concept of bits per pixel arises, more the bits per pixel, the more varueties of color you can get

then we learnt menthods of conversion of images from RGB to grayscale

then we learnt about histograms and how they are useful in image processing
and how processes like histogram stretching can be used to convert/ increase the contrast of an image

then we learnt about concepts like Concept of Convolution
Concept of Mask
Concept of Blurring
Sobel Operator
etc, which i think i'll have to go through again to understand more in depth

then , we were given an assignment regarding histgram stretching
